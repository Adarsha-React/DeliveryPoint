## Injected React into my application

**Using CDN links from React official page**

- There are two CDN links

  1. React - "react.development.js" - This javascript file will have core program of React. This can be used in React-Native also.
  2. ReactDOM - "react-dom.development.js" - This javascript file will have logic for rendering. Connection between browser and React.
  3. React will run only inside the below **root** element

     - <div id="root"> </div>

  4. **createElement** method is used to create a HTML element in React.
  5. **createRoot** is used to create root element from ReactDOM

### Other information

- Used **Emmet** to get the boiler plate code.
  **CDN** - Content Delivery Network
  Basically CDN links are used to access the library/code in a faster way, React is hosted on some server, we can get the required code into our app much fasterway using these links.
  **crossorign** - CORS
